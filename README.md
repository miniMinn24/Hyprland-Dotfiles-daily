## About My Dotfiles...

Of course, Arch Linux with Hyprland environment has been my primary choice (*3 years*) of Linux daily driving.
I frequently play around with dotfiles to customize the desktop I need: **both balance of ease of use and beautifulness**.
So I created this repo to share my customization dotfiles so you can explore, and also for my backup.

Hope you like my customization! ‚ú®
